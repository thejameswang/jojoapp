The Yo app but not
## How it works
Like the Yo app, the JoJo app sends a single message to users they are connected to.
Using react native, we published an app that allows the user to send apps and see all the messages the user has sent and been sent.

## Built with
* [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - An open source framework that builds native mobile apps using JavaScript and React.

* [Expo](https://expo.io/) - Open source toolchain built to use React native to help build native iOS and Android projects

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://developers.google.com/v8/), specifically the [Express framework](https://expressjs.com/) to create a web server on the Google Cloud server that would handle the front-end application requests.
